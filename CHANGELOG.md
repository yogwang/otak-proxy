# Change Log

## [2.2.9] - 2026-03-28

### Added
- Add `otakProxy.showProxyUrl` setting and `otak: Toggle Proxy URL Visibility` command to show/hide the proxy URL in the status bar for privacy (PR #7 by @yogwang)
  - When hidden, URLs are replaced with localized "Configured" text in both status bar and tooltip

### Fixed
- Deduplicate sync events to stop redundant "Proxy configured" notifications during multi-instance synchronization (PR #6 by @yogwang, closes #5)
  - Add version/state deduplication in SyncManager and ConflictResolver
  - Implement notification throttling in UserNotifier
  - Add silent mode for background sync and monitor-driven proxy transitions

## [2.2.8] - 2026-03-23

### Changed
- Add `otak:` prefix to all command titles for better discoverability in the Command Palette (PR #3 by @yogwang)
- Deduplicate and reorder i18n locale entries by scope
- Enrich config descriptions for `enableFallback`, `syncEnabled`, `syncInterval` across all locales

## [2.2.7] - 2026-02-17

### Changed
- Refactor: introduce `ErrorUtils` for type-safe error property access (`getErrorCode`, `getErrorMessage`, `getErrorStderr`, `getErrorSignal`, `wasProcessKilled`), replacing `error: any` casts across config managers and sync components
- Logger: respect `OTAK_PROXY_LOG_SILENT` env-var at the method level; improve type safety (`unknown` over `any`); sanitize error stack traces
- SyncManager: add periodic sync timer, `remoteChangeInProgress` guard to prevent concurrent remote/manual sync races, surface `instancesCleaned` in `SyncResult`
- Config managers (Git, npm, Terminal, VSCode, SystemProxyDetector): migrate to `ErrorUtils`; tighten TypeScript types
- All `otakProxy.*` settings are now excluded from VSCode Settings Sync: `proxyUrl`, `pollingInterval`, `maxRetries`, `testInterval`, `autoTestEnabled`, `enableFallback`, `syncInterval` → `machine-overridable` (workspace can still override); `detectionSourcePriority`, `syncEnabled` → `machine`

### Fixed
- ConflictResolver / SharedStateFile / FileWatcher: harden edge cases found during expanded property tests
- TestProxy: consolidate failure notifications into a single message (previously two sequential error toasts appeared)

## [2.2.5] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Status bar not updating when receiving proxy state changes from another VSCode instance via multi-instance sync

## [2.2.4] - 2026-02-16

### Fixed
- Multi-instance sync: proxy state changes via commands (toggle, configure URL, import) were not propagated to other VSCode instances

### Added
- UI i18n: Vietnamese (`vi`)

### Changed
